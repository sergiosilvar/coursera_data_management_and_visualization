# Week 1 Assignment

I've chosen the Gapminder dataset because of its simplicity and I'm interested in studying countries social and economics differences. In a first atemp, I'm focusing in find which variables correlate the most between themselves. I'm hopping the correlation can be used to cluster countries by their economic development, cultural traits or politic system.So, in a first glance, I'm selecting the variables: Polity Score, Oil per person, Eletric consumption per person, Employment rate, Life expectancy, Armed force rate and Urban rate. 

As a second topic, I'm interest in evaluate how the variables above iteract with Female employment rate. The participation of womem in the labor market may be an effect of the democractic system, as the later tends to score the public opinion of overall citizens and women, I hope, must be an active part of society.
